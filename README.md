# OWM JAPIs

#### Java Library for OpenWeatherMap.org Weather APIs

OWM JAPIs lets you develop weather-aware applications for **Java and Android platforms** in minimum time using OWM JAPIs, an easy-to-use, detailed and documented weather APIs' wrapper library for retrieving weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org. You can easily **retrieve and use weather data** in your applications using this library.

OWM JAPIs allows you to **fetch weather data in only 3-5 lines of code** (excluding any other/skeleton code, of course). You can develop applications and services for multiple platforms using this library, such as Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android.

#### Project history

This is a fork of [akapribot/OWM-JAPIs](https://github.com/akapribot/OWM-JAPIs) which has been abandoned by the author
in favor of a Kotlin rewrite: [aksinghnet/OWM-JAPIs](https://github.com/aksinghnet/OWM-JAPIs).
I prefer this Java-based version and intent to maintain it and add bugfixes.


### Why to use OWM JAPIs?
1. Free
2. Easy to use
3. Minimizes your code

OWM JAPIs lets you **focus just on your application's logic** and **weather retrieval code is provided** by this library. Additionally, weather retrieval code becomes very short using this library â€“ as less as 3-5 lines of code can get you weather data from OpenWeatherMap.org in your Java or Android application. **Surprising, right? Have a look on the example(s) below.**
